The course roughly corresponds to the first half-semester of the National Taiwan University course "Machine Learning". In this course, we emphasize the necessary fundamentals that give any student of machine learning a solid foundation, and enable him or her to exploit current techniques properly, explore further techniques and theories, or perhaps to contribute their own in the future.
