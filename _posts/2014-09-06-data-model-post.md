###Data Model Basic

Database model, it means a collection of concepts and rules used in defining data models:  for example the relational model uses relations and tuples, while the network model uses records, sets, and fields.

According to Hoberman (2009):

> "A data model is a way finding tool for both business and IT professionals, which uses a set of symbols and text to precisely explain a subset of real information to improve communication within the organization and thereby lead to a more flexible and stable application environment."

A data model can be sometimes referred to as a data structure, especially in the context of programming languages. Data models are often complemented by function models, especially in the context of enterprise models.

###Types of data models:

- database model
- data structure diagram
- entity-relationship model
- geographic data model
- generic data model
- semantic data model

In the field of database design, there are three different types of data models:

- conceptual data model
- logical data model
- physical data model

###Database model

- flat model
- hierarchical model
- network model
- relational model
- concept-oriented model
- star schema

###Why data model

Data modeling techniques and methodologies are used to model data in a standard, consistent, predictable manner in order to manage it as a resource.

Using data modeling:

- to assist people
- to manage data as a resource
- for the integraton of information systems
- for designing databases/data warehouses
	
The data models should ideally be stored in a repository so that they can be retrieved, expanded, and edited over time.

###Data model in Database

For database, Data model tells how the logical structure of a database is modeled. Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in DBMS. Data models define how data is connected to each other and how it will be processed and stored inside the system.

Entity-Relationship model is based on the notion of real world entities and relationship among them. While formulating real-world scenario into database model, ER Model creates entity set, relationship set, general attributes and constraints.

ER Model is best used for the conceptual design of database.

The most popular data model in DBMS is Relational Model. It is more scientific model then others. This model is based on first-order predicate logic and defines table as an n-ary relation.
