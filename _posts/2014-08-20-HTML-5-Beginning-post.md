###New Semantics Tags
	
Semantic = Meaning.   
Semantic elements = Elements with meaning.   
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: ***div and span*** - Tells nothing about its content.   
Examples of semantic elements: ***form, table, and img*** - Clearly defines its content.

HTML5 offers new semantic elements to clearly define different parts of a web page: ***header, nav, section, article, aside, figure, figcaption, footer, detail, summary, mark, time***. You can find detail from w3schools.com.   
The elements explained above are all block elements (except figcaption).

###Conditional comments
This is a special type of comment, where based on conditions comments are executed, even though comments are ignorable.

	<!--[if lt IE 9]>
 	If IE is lesser than 9 do some thing     <![endif]-->

###Tips for Structuring Code
Use HTML5 Boilerplates, as itâ€™s industry standard boilerplate template for the HTML5: 
	
	http://html5boilerplate.com/

as it includes all the basic setup and browser compatibility supports built in.
