            <article><p>Over the past couple of years, cloud applications like Google Docs and Force.com have come out of the closet and declared their value. Cloud computing provides on-demand use of cloud provider’s information technology (IT) infrastructures on a pay-per-use basis. Owing to the elasticity of cloud services, businesses are finding it attractive to adopt cloud computing. This essay will argue that cloud computing should become the future framework for enterprise information and communications technology. Firstly, this essay will define cloud computing, and then present three reasons why enterprises should use cloud services: to reduce the cost of IT operation, to afford powerful computing power for data-intensive background processing, and to provide energy-efficient and environment-friendly utilization of resources. Lastly, this essay will analyse the unsolved issues of cloud computing.

The essential meaning of cloud computing is based on Han’s paper which is the most frequently cited：“a model for enabling convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. network, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction” (Han, 2010, p. 88).</p>

<p>However, cloud computing is not simply a new set of technologies and business models, as Kushida, Muarray, and Zysman (2012) in their paper contended that “cloud computing is an innovation ecosystem, production platform, and global marketplace”.</p>

<p>Therefore, cloud computing is different from traditional grid computing or utility computing, and it has ability to sweep the business world. Furthermore, cloud computing has a strong possibility to be part of people’s life as well as electricity or running-water.</p>

<h4 id="to-begin-with-cloud-computing-is-convenient-and-low-cost-for-companies-to-implement-their-it-strategies">To begin with, cloud computing is convenient and low-cost for companies to implement their IT strategies.</h4>
<p>For most companies, IT operation is a large part of their budget, especially for the emerging companies. According to a study conducted by IBM Research in 2009, hardware, software, productivity improvements, automated provisioning, system administration, and IT staff will cost a large amount of money for companies. Especially for small businesses, IT expenditure will be a heavy burden for their operation. If these emerging companies should adopt cloud computing to replace their traditional IT department, they could save their money and pay more attention to their major businesses.</p>

<p>For instance, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), one kind of cloud service which can afford the virtual server for customers, and it charges users according to the time and IT resource that is used by the customers. Users could use the virtual server on-demand and stop the server at any time as if they have the real servers (Yang, 2012). Moreover, according to another survey of 186 banking technology professionals interested in cloud computing, 73 percent of the participants considered that cloud computing will enable them to meet user demands quickly, achieve scale profits, and save operating expenses (Crosman, 2010). Therefore, companies which want to reduce their IT spending should consider use cloud computing to improve their IT operation.</p>

<h4 id="additionally-cloud-computing-can-provide-data-intensive-computing-with-strong-technical-support">Additionally, cloud computing can provide data-intensive computing with strong technical support.</h4>
<p>The meaning of data-intensive computing is a kind of computing service which uses massive storage or enormous computing power to execute complex tasks, such as the search engine or the weather forecast. Shamsi, Khojaye, and Qasmi (2013) in their paper argue that scalability, availability, and elasticity are the main challenges of data-intensive service. Complex queries and timely results should be meted in such kind of service in that users have less patience to wait for the results.</p>

<p>However, cloud computing has advantages to overcome these three issues: 
- For scalability, cloud computing is a dynamic system which gets the computing power based on the service scale, and the service scale could be adjusted in near real-time;
- For availability, owing to  hardware consolidation, cloud computing has the mechanism of dynamic scheduling to improve the fault tolerance when the system failure occurs;
- For elasticity, cloud service utilizes a different amount of system resources according to the kind of service request.</p>

<p>Therefore, using cloud computing to support data-intensive computing can provide better data locality and reduce blockage in data transmission (Shamsi et al., 2013).</p>

<h4 id="in-addition-to-saving-costs-and-providing-strong-support-for-data-intensive-computing-cloud-computing-can-also-provide-energy-efficient-and-environment-friendly-utilization-of-resources">In addition to saving costs and providing strong support for data-intensive computing, cloud computing can also provide energy-efficient and environment-friendly utilization of resources.</h4>

<p>With energy-efficient computing model, cloud computing can minimize contamination being caused by modern electronic technology. Moreover, under the environment of cloud computing, cloud providers can bring together data centers including large number of servers and storages, and it will be both cost effective and also environmentally safer (Krill, 2010). That is to say, scale effect can reduce carbon emissions and increase energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Consequently, cloud computing is an environment friendly technology which can help companies to achieve their “green” goals (Bidgoli, 2010). US$ 7.2 billon is cost on the electricity use for server farms worldwide in 2005, according to a study conducted by Lee and Zomaya (2010). This study also indicates that electricity consumption in that year had doubled as compared with consumption in 2000. By contrast, cloud computing is well suited to implement resource allocation strategy to improve the energy efficiency because of the resources integration.</p>

<p>As the result of optimizing resources allocation strategy, the energy efficiency can be increased and the energy consumption can be reduced. In addition, computing resources can be scheduled by unified management, and the idle servers could be automatically closed, without any administrator intervention. Therefore, it’s both energy-efficient and environment-friendly for companies to utilize cloud service.</p>

<p>However, some issues should be considered if a company decides to use the cloud service. As Khan and Malluhi (2010) states in their article, cloud computing also has the problems which are raised in traditional computing models. Data security, dependability, system performance, and control of the IT infrastructure are four principal factors should be considered. Therefore, companies should consider carefully the risk of their migration to the cloud.</p>

<p>To improve the performance of cloud computing, Matrens and Teuteberg (2011) in their paper demonstrate that storing data in multiple service providers and backing up data on internal servers should be adopted to improve security. In addition, Bidgoli (2010) in his paper gave a six-step conceptual model for managers and IT personnel who want to minimize the security and privacy concerns with rapid technological change.</p>

<p>In conclusion, costs of cloud computing will be affordable for enterprises, companies can get a high return on investment (ROI), and the consolidation of computing facilities is beneficial to the ecosystem. Cloud computing has a significant potential to change the future direction of current information technology, and that failure is likely if no action is taken by companies, especially the emerging corporations. Both emerging companies and larger companies should catch the chance of this technological evolution. Therefore, cloud computing should be the future framework for enterprise information and communications technology. However, further studies should identify potential problems which are related to the data control and service quality, the related policies in different countries should also be considered.</p>
